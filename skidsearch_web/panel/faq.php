<p>Q: What is SkidSearch?</p>
<p>A: SkidSearch is the longest running, largest Minecraft DB search engine.</p>
<p>We aim to provide a means to assess what data has been leaked in said breaches, at no cost to the public.
We have been around for over 3 years, and will be for many more. Which can't be said about any of our competitors.
Enjoy Searching.</p>

<p>Q: Nothing happens when I search?</p>
<p>A: If the site just 'refresh's, that means there were no results for your search, try old usernames, and their UUID.</p>

<p>Q: What are the Search Methods for?
</p><p>A: Search methods can be used to fine-tune your query, for example, if you play on multiple accounts -</p>
<p>you can search your IP to find all your breached accounts, rather than each username/uuid.</p>
<p>UUIDs are useful for accounts with a lot of usernames (when you change your username, your UUID doesnt)</p>
<p>SteamID searches contain a handful of large Rust server DBs, and take the Steam64 ID (i.e: 76561190000000)</p>
